## Nature and Nurture: Understanding the Etiology of Substance Use Disorders Among Adolescents

Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) affect about 5% of adolescents and can lead to a host of personal and societal problems. From an epidemiological perspective, risk factors such as peer pressure, permissive parenting, and impulsiveness make SUDs more probable, whereas protective factors like community engagement and drug prevention education alleviate this risk. No single factor is a determinant of SUDs. This research builds an ensemble learning framework to predict adolescents at risk for SUDs by considering an interplay between the different factors. A data-driven model of 34 factors reflecting multiple dimensions of an adolescentâ€™s sphere of life is derived from over 100 questions in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. These factors are split into two groups; Nature includes characteristics that are individual-centric, whereas Nurture includes environmental influences. Two ensemble classifiers, gradient boosting and random forest are trained, while applying the SMOTE algorithm to consider class imbalance. Both classifiers can distinguish between adolescents with and without SUDs exceptionally accurately, with AUC (Area Under ROC curve) over 0.9. They outperform logistic regression, commonly used in epidemiological research. The approach reveals that impulsive and risk taking personality combined with easy availability of substances results in highest risk. These findings contribute to the nature vs. nurture debate in suggesting that SUDs among adolescents may not be exclusively attributed to natural tendencies or environmental influences but arise from their confluence. They may also offer a rationale for why SUDs are prevalent among adolescents in both low socioeconomic and affluent communities.
